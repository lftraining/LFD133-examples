# LFD133-examples 
Demo code in the LFD133 Introduction to WebAssembly module can be retrieved here. For example, in the chapter titled "Practical WebAssembly", each toolchain discussed includes a demo with a hello world example and a Mandelbrot fractal example. The purpose of this repo is to allow learners to follow along with demos by practicing the concepts of each demo themselves.
